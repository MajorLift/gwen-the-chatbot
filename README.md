# Gwen the Chatbot

A simple chatbot completed as a takehome assignment, and also as a first foray into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

The requirements were as follows:
- Messages are shown in colored bubbles.
- The computer generates random conversation on one side, and the user can respond on the other.
- The screen automatically follows and flows the posted messages.
- Each message shows a timestamp.
- Citations for mutiple lines of code taken from online sources.

I chose to have the chatbot go through the 36 questions for "Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness" (1997)
developed by psychologist Arthur Aron, and popularized in a New York Times column entitled ["The 36 Questions That Lead to Love."](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html)
